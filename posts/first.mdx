# How We Got Here
I've been a front-end developer for about six years now, mostly working for startups and some corporations.
This has given me amazing opportunities and enough room to develop my programming skills to a level I can be proud of. However, there is a problem.

### How It All Started

I've always loved technology. Any chance I had to play around with computers, cellphones, or video game consoles,
I took. I only discovered programming in my last year of high school. With my late entry into programming, 
I've mostly focused on learning skills that would help me in a work environment.
These include front-end tools and languages like [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), *CSS*, and *HTML*. Learning all of these tools and different variations of them has been a blast, 
but I've never had a chance to use them as tools for myself to explore my own creativity.

### Creativity and How It's Usually Dismissed

I've spoken to many people about creativity, and most of the conversations end up being non-productive because, 
in my experience, it is often dismissed in favor of entrepreneurship or some form of STEM-based field like engineering or medicine. 
I've now hit a ceiling where I've explored the front-end development world in the context of business and had all the fun I could with it.

This is where the creativity that was laid dormant for all of these years comes in. 
I can now use the skills I've gained throughout my career to build things I find fun and engaging. 
My GitHub is a testament to this because I've been playing around with different technologies to build silly websites that I find funny. 
Although at the time of writing this most of them are not complete, I've had so much fun spinning them up.

### Where to From Here

There is now an itch in my brain that needs to be scratched. 
I've tapped into my own creativity and I cannot stop thinking about all the possibilities of the things I can make. 
This is why I've created this blog: to keep track of all the ideas and half-baked GitHub repositories. 
This blog is going to be the tracker of all things creative that I do, both big and small.

I want to keep the blog as casual as possible and I also want to maintain a steady pace with the posts I make because life gets busy. 
[Blog post on this soon](https://amajola.xyz/blog). Hopefully, this is the start of something I can be proud of.

#### Shoutouts

[Guide Fari](https://www.guidefari.com/): What Guide has done with [Goosebumps](https://www.goosebumps.fm/words) has heavily inspired this site, down to the tech stack that I'm using. 
His constant affirmation and encouragement are what led me to create this site and the many other things on my GitHub repo. So, a big shoutout to Mr. Guide.
